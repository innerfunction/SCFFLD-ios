# SCFFLD ios
JSON based dependency injection for iOS.

The core SCFFLD package provides the following:

* JSON configuration loading;
* Dependency injection (DI) / inversion of control (IoC) containers;
* Internal URI system;
* App container and core UI components;

See the wiki for more information.

## Installation
Install using CocoaPods:
```ruby
pod 'SCFFLD'
```

## Sample app
A sample app with example configurations and code can be found under [test/SCFFLD-testapp](test/SCCFLD-testapp).


## Status
SCFFLD is currently beta software. Much of the core code is well tested and has been used in a variety of production products, but some details - particularly configuration APIs of core UI components - may still be changed.
